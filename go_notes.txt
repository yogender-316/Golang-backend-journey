No implicit type conversions in go
        Why Go enforces this (important for jobs)

        Faster performance

        Predictable memory layout

        Safer concurrent programs

        Fewer runtime bugs

can do type conversions explicit...and also dont change type in run time 

this brings to interfaces which we gonna learn afterwards

Why Go does this (design reason)

Go forces explicitness:

Index access = intentional mutation

Value access = read-only copy

This avoids accidental mutation bugs common in other languages. 

for i:= range arr{
        index 
}
_,i:=range arr
{
         value
}
